There is a slight glitch with the CASTLING move, its not 100% perfect. it DOES check whether the king has never moved before and whether the rook involved in castling hasn't moved before and whether the spaces between them are empty. and whether castling maintains the safety of the king. BUT there are additional conditions for castling that I didnt put in, because I just coded it yesterday. but the castling move wasn't in the proposal so I hope that's okay :p


Also, you just need to know TWO things to start playing chess:
 
1) A player may not make any move that would PUT or LEAVE his king under attack. If the player to move has no legal moves, the game is over; it is either a checkmate (a loss for the player with no legal moves) if the king is under attack, or a stalemate (a draw) if the king is not.

2) Each piece has its own style of moving:
	•	The king moves one square in any direction. 
	•	The rook can move any number of squares along any rank or file, but may not 		leap over other pieces.
	•	The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but may not leap over 		other pieces.
	•	The queen combines the power of the rook and bishop and can move any number 		of squares along rank, file, or diagonal, but it may not leap over other pieces.
	•	The knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same 		rank, file, or diagonal, thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically 		and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. 		The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.
	•	The pawn may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of 		it on the same file, or on its first move it may advance two squares along the same 		file provided both squares are unoccupied; or the pawn may capture an opponent's 		piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that 		square. The pawn can be promoted to a Queen/bishop/rook if it reaches the last rank 		on the opposite side of the board.
